The solution is to ensure that the observer is always removed in the object's `dealloc` method. This prevents the observer from retaining the observed object and causing a memory leak.  Here's how to fix the code:

```objectivec
@implementation FixedKVOSample

- (void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath ofObject:(id)object change:(NSDictionary *)change context:(void *)context {
    // Handle KVO notification
}

- (void)startObserving {
    [someObject addObserver:self forKeyPath:@"someProperty" options:NSKeyValueObservingOptionNew context:NULL];
}

- (void)stopObserving {
    [someObject removeObserver:self forKeyPath:@"someProperty"];
}

- (void)dealloc {
    [self stopObserving];
    [super dealloc];
}

@end
```
By calling `removeObserver:forKeyPath:` in the `dealloc` method, we guarantee that the observer is removed before the observed object is deallocated.
